body: "The code library that comes with the Arduino (platform) is very safe and easy to use. The price you pay is speed. It kills it. These APIs are meant for rapid prototyping and for lowering the learning curve.\nOnce you have a clear understanding of what you need to do (I think you do already) you could consider moving to AVR-Studio 6 (free) or writing it in assembly (never done that myself). These options will give you better performance and more control (and more things to manage). \n\nI wonder what happens when you use version 1 of your code (interrupts) with the fast write functions...?"
