  Wow! Thanks for replying Vincent! I really didn't notice this rather big mistake. I would really love to edit and run the first fixed version of the code again and see if it works. But I am currently in the process of moving to another house, so all my electronics have already been stored in boxes. Most likely it will take me at least 2 months to unpack everything and get settled, so this will have to wait.

  If you do use the code and get the first version working, please do share your experiences in the comments.


  In the mean time I will update this blog with your correction and also change the code on GitHub.

  Thanks for the sharp look at my code!
