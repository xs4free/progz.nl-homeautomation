body: "Leon and JFDB, if the code works on one device and doesn't work on a different device, we should actually look at the differences.\nBut at Leon it doesn't work on a 3.3V Pro while at JFDB it DOES work on a 3.3V Pro. And here I had it working on my 3.3V Pro too (a long time ago). I must say that I am currently only working with an ESP8266, so I cannot see how it works on another device.\n\nIt would be really nice if we can find out why it doesn't work. We can all learn from it and it may make things better.  :)\n\nPerhaps you can add some debugging to the IthoCC1101.cpp file? \n(I did that too, when I had problems figuring out why things went wrong).\n\nPlease find the checkForNewPacket() function and just add the following:\nSerial.print(\"L=\"); Serial.println(length); \nafter each line with length = receiveData(...);\nThat will just show if any data is received at all.\nIf you replace \"L=\" with someting more logical like L1, L2, ... for each one, we can also see which length is displayed.\nAs soon as we know those values, we can investigate further.\n\nI can help you with an even nicer debug option, a LED lighting up when something comes into the RX buffer, but that will need some more extra coding. (that's part of an interrupt driven version that I am currently working on)\n\nAlso make sure that you are really within range between the RFT module and the cc1101. I noticed that the cc1101 with a simple antenna is not as sensitive as the ITHO box.  (once I had a broken link to the antenna and then it only worked within 5cm)\nWith the original antenna delivered with the cc1101 modules, reception is still very bad, with a 8.5cm wire-antenna it's slightly better, with a 2x8cm dipole more better, but I'm still not happy with the reception here."
