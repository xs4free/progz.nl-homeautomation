  Klusjesman, I am using your SPI code.

  I even tried to do two consecutive reads from the same register like:


  uint8_t CC1101::readRegister(uint8_t address)

  {
    uint8_t val1, val2;
    do
    {
      spi->select();
      spi_waitMiso();
      spi->write(address);
      val1 = spi->read();
      spi->write(address);
      val2 = spi->read();
      spi->deselect();
    }
    while (val1 != val2)
    return val1;
  }


  But this is not fast enough to read the same value consecutively while the number of bytes is updated in the TX_BUFFER.


  How did this work for you? See my other post below, I am puzzled that this problem did not occur in your code
