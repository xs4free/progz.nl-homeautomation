  Dear Klusjesman,

  After checking with Rogier's description  I can see that the "wrong" message bytes (nearly) all relate to the device ID or the checksum.

  I understand I can remove these print statements and all will work fine, but now that I have come this far I would like to understand it better (until I get bored and I just want it to work)

  What was not clear to me is what happens if I change the device ID in your code, will the calculation of checksum and other bytes become incorrect?

  Does your code only work with the hard coded device ID? (I think so but I am not sure)


  I understand I can extract my device ID from the message dump provided by your program, but can I reconstruct the full message needed for this device ID (i.e., is there a sound algorithm to do this), or do I need to solve my own puzzle (pressing all the buttons and recording the messages) like you and Rogier apparently did.


  In my previous post I could not print the angled brackets in the following statement:


  "except for the BBuart library, that was included with

  #include (angled bracket open) BBuart.h (angled bracket close)

  (note the angled brackets instead of the quotes)"
