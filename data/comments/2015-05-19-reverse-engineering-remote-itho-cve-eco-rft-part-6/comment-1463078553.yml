  Dear Klusjesman,

  I tried the join command, but the program hangs AFTER sending the first message.

  It never completes sending the second message (which is also the only message longer than 64 bytes)

  full, medium low, timer1, timer 2 and timer 3 work fine. leave also but that message gets send a lot of times (30 times?)

  I am at a loss, is there something wring in the code sending a message longer than 64 bytes?
