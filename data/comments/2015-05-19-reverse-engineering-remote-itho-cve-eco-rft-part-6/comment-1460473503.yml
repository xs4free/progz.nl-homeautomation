  It took some time, but now I have an RTL-SDR.

  What I see is that the original RFT transmitter does a transmission at 868.something MHz.  I see thee short transmissions.

  With the arduino/cc11xx, when I keep the antannas very close to each other, I only see 3 slight shifts in the noise over all the bandwidth.  When I "tune" to a totally different frequency (like 433MHz), I still see such a slight noise change.  What I suspect is that the cc11xx does transmit something 3 times, but at a totally wrong frequency.  Because I don't know how to figure out where or what it transmits, it still stucks me here.

  (I am using an RTL-SDR stick with the R820T2 chip and the SDRSharp software)
