  The code is used to emulate UART TX and RX. So you can assign almost any pin on your MCU to be used for the emulation.


  The Itho code on GitHub is a small portion of a much bigger project and in this project I need to use emulation. My real onboard UART RX and TX pins are used for a RS485 network, this is why I am using serial emulation. I want to be able to log to the serial port and use the RS485 network at the same time. This is also why you can easily remove the code from the project and use some serial communication feature from Arduino.
