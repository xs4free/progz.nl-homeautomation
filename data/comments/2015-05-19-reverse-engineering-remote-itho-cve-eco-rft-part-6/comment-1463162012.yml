  It is nice it is working for more people. Jimmy also helped me to finish and test the code and we discussed our findings so he also was a great help!


  It is strange the readRegisterWithSyncProblem didn't work for you. I followed the errata document, just to be sure to have a reliable system. In the beginning I was using a slightly different solution with max 4 iterations to retrieve valid register values. If it didn;t succeed then I just took the last read. But I was always able to get 2 consequtive reads with the same value within those 4 tries. So it is really strange.


  The most interesting change in the code would be to get rid of the arrays. Or to just loop through a small subset so the arrays can be smaller.


  I will accept the request on github. Probably tomorrow. I just gave it a try but I cannot remember my credentials, so I will check it on my development pc tomorrow.
