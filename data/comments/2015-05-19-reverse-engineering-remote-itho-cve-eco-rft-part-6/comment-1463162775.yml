  About the 61 bytes I am using in my code. The RFT is setting up the status bytes on the CC1101 so there were 2 bytes added to each message (on receiving). This was the configuration I used in the beginning. For the third byte was also a valid reason but I cannot remember. In the current implementation the status bytes are not enabled. But they can be added again if you like (the reverse engineered CC1101 commands used by Itho are in my code). Then you will have details about data quality.


  The 61 can be changed to 64, but it doesn't really matter I think. Also the while during sending can be changed to already start transmitting when there is 1 byte space available in the FIFO.
