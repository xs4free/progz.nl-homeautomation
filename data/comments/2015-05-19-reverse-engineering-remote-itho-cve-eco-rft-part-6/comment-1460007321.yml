body: "Hi Jimmy,\n\nOnly a few registers have problems accepting values. When I write 0x40 to DEVIATN for example, it returns 0x47 after reading. Similar problems for FREQ0, MSMCFG4,3,2. However, some values are being accepted. All other registers are ok. It is not related with the unused bits which are ignored by the CC1101. Because the 0x40 vs 0x47 has its difference in the last 3 bits, and they are used according RFstudio.\n\n#define CC1101_DEFVAL_FREQ2_868 0x21 - is ok after reading\n#define CC1101_DEFVAL_FREQ1_868 0x62 - is ok after reading\n#define CC1101_DEFVAL_FREQ0_868 0x76 - always gives me 0xEC after reading. Some other values I tested are being accepted. \n\nMaybe I should try one of the other boards I have. Just to be sure."
