  Hi Rogier,


  I got exactly the same module by the looks of it ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/281431437869 ), chip has 1150 number on it but sadly no luck on a working thing. I can send a join command but the Itho does not respond.


  Have you had any chance on further exploring this thing, maybe make some code to 'listen' with the cc1150 to the current remote control or something like that ?


  Great work so far !
