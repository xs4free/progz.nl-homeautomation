  My problem with writing to some registers seems to be solved. Yesterday I was writing some code for a FRAM chip using SPI and it didn't work. In the end I found out that it was because of my breadboard/wiring. With really short wires it was working without any problems. So today I decided to go ahead with the CC1101 using short wires and guess what, it is writing and reading nicely to all registers.


  When I have more time I will continue testing with the reception of RF messages.
