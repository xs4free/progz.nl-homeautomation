  Hi Jimmy,


  I am experiencing similar problems with registers not being changed. Some values are accepted and some values are not for the same register. I installed SmartRF and retrieved all default values, but still some of them are not set. I checked the marcstate and it is in the required idle state. I cannot find a reason in the datasheet for this problem. Also searching the internet didn't help me much.
