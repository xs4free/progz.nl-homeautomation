body: Jimmy, you are right about the transmit command for the CC1101 already being in the code. I just checked the datasheets for both the CC1150 and the CC1101 and both use the same register address 0x35 for the STX command. Since the code was developed and tested on a CC1150, I'm can't say if everything else is the same. For that you should compare both datasheets very carefully.
