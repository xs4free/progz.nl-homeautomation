body: "Thanks (both) for your replies, \n\nI indeed got it working by adding some code. I tried to make this a \"mysensor\" node to easily integrate into my domoticz. but unfortunately I was not successful in having two SPI devices combined (CC1011 and NRF24L01). therefore I now use two arduino's that communicate with some IO pin's (not the most elegant way, but it works)  However I wonder that the while loop does, you say it monitors the communication, but I thought  the receiving part was not operational? or should that work as well. (the pins are not connected now I think?)"
