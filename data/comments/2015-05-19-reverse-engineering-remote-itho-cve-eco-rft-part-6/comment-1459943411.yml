  Your prints look similar to the ones I am using. A few days ago I ordered some more (with pins soldered on them) from different places.


  This morning I talked with a colleague of mine and he asked if the CC1101 on the print is an original TI one. The same thought already crossed my mind. I don't know.


  I found one other person on the TI forum with a similar register write problem. But unfortunately the thread is a few years old and the answer is not there.


  I think I will continue when the new prints arrive. Because at the moment I don't have a clue why it is not working. Even if the filters on the print are for a different frequency, why would it have any impact on register writes?
