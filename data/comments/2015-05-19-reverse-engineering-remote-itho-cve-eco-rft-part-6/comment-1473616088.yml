  Hi Jimmy,


  I started your code as recommended by JFdB.

   got all the parts, soldered it together and loader the program, so up and running. However I'm not so experienced in coding and now have a question. In the code of Rogier it works with 4 buttons, however in your code I do not see the buttons in the code. Is this with a reason, do I need to add this code myself or do I miss something?
