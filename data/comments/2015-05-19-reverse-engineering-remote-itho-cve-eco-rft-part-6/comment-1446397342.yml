  The one I bought also looks exactly like the image and is 868 MHz. I bought it on ebay i think, or aliexpress. w-tx1150 is written on the small board. I just checked it but I am not able to find the same component on the sites i mentioned earlier.


  Some while ago I played with the cc1150. I was able to communicate with it and set the frequency and do a read out etc. So my 3v-5.5v conversion with some mosfets and resistors were also working nicely. When I wanted to start sending messages to the ventilation unit I ran into some strange atmega problems (reset). Turned out I didn;t have enough memory on board, so I bought some other atmega's. But since then I didn;t touch the configuration anymore. I'm just to busy with my company. So I guess this will be a long term project for me.


  I will order some CC1101, just in case I find some time to play.
