body: Hoi Rogier, thanks, yes I discovered how it "works" in the datasheet. It doesn't seem to be changeable easy. Do you know if somebody has used the 868MHz version of the 1101? Because I can't find a 1105 at 868MHz but I can find the 1101 at 868MHz (will take another 3 weeks on ebay).  People above spoke about it but nobody shared his experiences afterwards.
