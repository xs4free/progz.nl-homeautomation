body: "Hi Leon, Yes the receiving part works fine, as long as the loop is able to run the checkForNewpacket nearly realtime.\nOne 'problem' is that the original RFT module is sending 2 different codes within a very short time, and the checkForNewPacket needs to be called for both codes to work. So it will only work if checkForNewpacket fast enough.\n\n(I am currently working on a different approach for receiving, that only needs 1 of the 2 code, and is able to buffer the result)\n\nFor 2 SPI devices to work, you need to find a way to give both a different CSN/SS/Chip Select pin. \nThen you need to modify their libraries to use those different pins. \nJust check if your nrf24l01 also uses gpio15 for the select pin.\nTo change it for the cc1101, just change any occurance of 'SS' (which is defined as 15) in CC1101.cpp to another pin. If you can change it for the cc1101, you can continue to use it for the nrf24l01.\nI am not sure if all will still work then, never tested it..."
