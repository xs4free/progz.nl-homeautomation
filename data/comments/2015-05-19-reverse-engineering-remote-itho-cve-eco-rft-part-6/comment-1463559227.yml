  Hi all,  sorry for the silence. Before posting my Arduino (and ESP8266) code, I want to do a big clean-up.

  What I want to do is to create a fork of Klusjesman's code and then put my modifications onto that (on my fork).

  But now I see that JFdeB is also making changes to klusjesman's code and I am not sure if I want/need those in my Arduino/ESP8266 version.


  So @Klusjesman, can you confirm that you are confident with JFdeB's changes, and should I take those into my code too?
