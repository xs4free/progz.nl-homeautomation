body: "Hoi Jimmy, I haven't tried a 433MHz module myself, so I cannot definitely comfirm if it will work or not. \nMy best guess is that it won't work, or maybe with a very reduced range. The contradicting specs that you've read are that the CC1150 chips supports all frequencies, but the design of board determines which filters are used between the chip and the antenna. If you open the data sheet for the CC1150, you can find a reference design for a 433 and one for a 866 MHz board. Judging from the photo and the title of article that you found, this is actually the 433 MHz version. That means the filters on this board will most likely cancel out most of the 866 MHz transmission that you want to sent to the Itho.\nIf you don't want to much trouble, try to get a 866MHz board."
