body: "To sniff the SPI traffic I bought a Saleae logic analyzer. Based on the datamessages we already have you should only need one message from your own remote to find out what ID it is using.  \n\nI guess it should be possible to intercept RF traffic from the Itho remote when the same settings (freq) are used. It would be a nice option to verify your own transmitter.\n\nThe last months I did not spend time on the Itho remote. I want to have the whole home automation system running soon, so I spend time on the bus system, protocol and all sensors involved (co2,voc,light,temp,humidy). I only have to program some code to control a touchscreen. I bought a PWM module for the Itho RFT but it turns out this isn;t working. It would be an easy solution and quick implementation to control the fan using PWM. I am in contact with Itho about it. If PWM is not working then I will continue with the Itho remote.\n\nIt is nice to see more people are working on the same subject."
