body: "You can ignore those bytes which are not ok. I was using the messages during development. Everytime a message is received from the Itho remote I am trying to construct the same message based on a few variables only. This is not working for you because your device id is different. Also the way I am calculating the counter bytes (6 changing bytes on every button press) is not correct since it depends on the device id. I don't have time to find out more details about it. It isn;t that important (for me) also. \n\nYou can remove the function which is producing the error messages.\ncounter=49, full is printed in the main(). This is the button you pressed. All other prints (IthoCC1101.c) on the serial port can be removed.\n\nWhen you join my code to the Itho RFT then you will be able to control the ventilator."
