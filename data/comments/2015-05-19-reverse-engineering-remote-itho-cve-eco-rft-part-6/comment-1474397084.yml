body: Hi Jimmy, all clear. For now I have the CC1011 connected to a arduino Nano with resistors. If I add addition wires for the other RF module I already stops working. When I have my 3.3V pro in I will test in on that one to combine the two SPI devices. It is easy to use a different pin for the NRF24L01 so I will try. I do however not see the commands from my standard remote coming in. Even if I use your code without any modifications. Any clue where to look into?
