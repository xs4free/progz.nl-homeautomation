body: "On ebay I found, and ordered, this module: http://www.ebay.com/itm/281431437869\nThe title says 433Mz, but the description has \"Operating in the 315/433/868/915 MHz ISM/SRD bands\".\nWould this module work?\nMy coding and electronics skills are not very good. If I try and it does not work, would leave me with the question if it's the module or something I did wrong.  \n(buying a 1101 would also be a possibility but I really don't understand what I would have to change for that)"
