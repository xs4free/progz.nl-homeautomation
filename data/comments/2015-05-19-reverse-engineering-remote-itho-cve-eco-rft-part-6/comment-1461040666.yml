  There's not much noise and not much difference between the RFT and CC1101 signals.

  Sometime I seem to miss a bit (partial), but I think that is not because the RFT/CC1101 but because I have to use the RTL-SDR on the edge of speed.

  E.g. I need to use a sample rate of 3.2MSPS, while documentation says 2.56 is max for most environments.


  For now I am manually looking at the captured signal and finding the 1's and 0's.

  (which is difficult when sometimes losing a bit)

  So for me the 170's are also very handy to see if I am still "reading in sync".

  When placing multiple captured waves next to each other, it's possible to find the differences.

  If I find such a difference I need to find the actual position in the bitstream compared to the Arduino code, to figure out what the real difference is.

  That way I found my own RFT ID. (which I need to double-check because it still doesn't work)


  You are right that the counters cannot be too exact.  On the other hand, those are the only difference I can find now.

  If I have more time to spend, I could try to capture and decode one packet from the RFT, try to recalculate the counters and send that from the Arduino/cc1101.


  I am now comparing my RFT low/mid/high/timer codes, to see what my RFT actually sends.
