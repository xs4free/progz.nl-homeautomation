body: "Hi Rogier,\n Sorry for spamming your blog so much.\nYou have \"mask = 10000000;\" instead of \"mask = B10000000;\" in your code Without the 'B', you will use '100110001001011010000000', but the var type is byte so only the first 8 bits are used (which are exactly '10000000', so lucky you).  :)\n\nYou have this:\n cc1150.writeRegister(CC1150_IOCFG0, CC1150_DEFVAL_IOCFG1); //0x02 0x2E\n cc1150.writeRegister(CC1150_IOCFG1, CC1150_DEFVAL_IOCFG1); //0x01 0x2E\n Is that first line correct? It writes the IOCFG1 value to the IOCFG0 register...\n \nconst int itho_RF_Delay = 75; //microseconds\nconst int itho_RFT_Delay = 0; //microseconds\nThose seem to be used to make the RISING edge fall nicely in the middle of the data.\nBut why are they so very different? Is that related to the different values for MDMCFG4? (4004 / 8008 / 38383 baud)\n\nAt this page, I read that the join is sent 4 times instead of 3: http://zigbeeme.blogspot.nl/2014/10/decoding-itho-rf-protocol.html\nint signalConnectRepeats =4 ;\nint signalDisconnectRepeats =4 ;\nint signalTimerRepeats =3;\nThat shouldn't be any problem, I even tried it with the loop at 30 times without a result.\n\nIn your code, you have:\n#define ITHO_REMOTE2\n#if defined(ITHO_REMOTE1)\n...\n#else\n...\n#endif\nI tried it with a defined ITHO_REMOTE1, but still no resonse to the join.\n\nI spent two days searching for any (usable) clue on how to make a receiver with the serial communication mode.\nSPI cannot be used twice (easily) and SPI cannot handle incoming SCLK. Rewrite a second SPI looked too tricky to me.\nI guess we need to use GDO0 as a clock-in and then read the bits from GDO2. GDO2 is now connected to pin 4 (not 3, which is also timer2/interrupt1). \nBut because I am a noob at programming and I am afraid that I make things more worse than better (because it probably involves interrupts that will conflict with the rest of the code), I am completely unable to create anything.  :(\nPerhaps you could just help me out with that? I think a simple  (quick and dirty) receiver solves all problems.\n\nA week ago at http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/1524421/last  I tried finding someone who could help me testing the TX, but nobody responded until now. :("
