  Hey Erwin,

  Listening to the current remote and extracting the id is a task that is high up on my wishlist/todo-list. Sadly, this won't be possible with the CC1150, since this is a transmit-only chip. If you want to listen/receive you need the CC1101 chip. The link you sent is to a 1150 chip with a filter set for the 433 MHz band. So that might just be a very reasonable explanation why your Itho isn't responding to the join command you sent (the Itho is only using the 868 MHz band).

  Just to double check, are you removing the power from the ventilation-unit and sending the signal during the first two minutes after you restore power? Because that is the only moment the Itho ventilation-unit will allow new remotes to join.

  Since my last blogpost I moved to another house and sadly the new house doesn't contain a Itho ventilation unit YET. In the next few months I will most likely install an Itho unit and start working on this project again. In the mean time I will search for a CC1101 chipset on 868 MHz and link it in on this blog, because a lot of people are asking trying to recreate my setup and want to use my code.

  In the mean time, if you have any progress with you setup, please let me know!
