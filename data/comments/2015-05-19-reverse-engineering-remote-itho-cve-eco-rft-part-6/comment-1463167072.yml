body: "What I don not like about the fix is that it is not robust. I tried to think through the consequences of the \ntxStatus = (readRegister(CC1101_TXBYTES | CC1101_STATUS_REGISTER) & CC1101_BITS_RX_BYTES_IN_FIFO\nreporting the wrong number of bytes in the TX_buffer. If it reports more bytes than there actually are -> no problem, on the next loop it will be most likely correct.\nIf the number of bytes in the TX_buffer is reported smaller than it actually is, then the program thinks it can send more bytes into the buffer than there is actually space and data in the FIFO will be overwritten.\nI tried to create this situation to see what kind of error would be reported, but I could not write data fast enough into the buffer to create an overwrite.\nI was expecting that a TXFIFO_UNDERFLOW would be created, because due to the overwrite, less data is written to the buffer than needs to be send.\nThis error could be caught by the program an handled to make the program robust."
