  Dear Jimmy,

  Can you post the changes that you made to the code of Klusjesman? I downloaded his code, and I have great difficulty to incorporate the assembler code (the .S file). The arduino compiler is complaining a lot about this file. And I have not even encountered the SPI problems that you mention above, so I do not know what awaits me.
