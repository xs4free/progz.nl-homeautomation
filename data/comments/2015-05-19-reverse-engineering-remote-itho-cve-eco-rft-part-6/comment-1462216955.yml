body: "Wow! Sounds like you implemented all functionality anyone will need. As sons as I have an Itho box installed I will test your code. In the mean time I will be looking at your code and compare your way of calculating the sequence numbers. I'm very anxious to see if your method can calculate the numbers I captured from my old 2 remotes. \nThanks a lot for sharing your code!\nI would love to hear more about the project you have setup in your house. Sounds like you have already done what I'm dreaming about. :)"
