body: "Hi Marcel, \nI've searched my development machine, but can't seem to find the old (CC1101) versions of my code. I should have started using GitHub straight away...\nIn my previous posts there are a few links to the CC1101 libraries I used. Maybe they are useful for you as well?\nMost of the code should be the same, since the CC1101 and CC1150 share a lot of registers. The only big difference between the CC1101 and CC1150 is that the CC1101 is also a receiver, because of that you will need to make a few extra calls to switch to transmit mode (which the CC1150 defaults to straight away).\nI would love to experiment with the CC1101 my self, but I recently moved and all my parts are still in moving-boxes. I also don't have an Itho ventilation unit in my new house YET, so it's probably going to be a few more months before I'm up and running again.\nIf you have written any code in the mean time, please let me know. I would love to take a look and help you out in any way I can.\n\nRegards, Rogier."
