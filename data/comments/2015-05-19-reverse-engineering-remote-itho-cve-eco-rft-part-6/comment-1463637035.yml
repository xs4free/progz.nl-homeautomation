  Hi Jimmy,

  I just checked your code on github, you are using  readRegisterMedian3 in stead of  readRegisterWithSyncProblem, which is my workaround.

  I did speed tests and the problem is resolved if you increase the SPI interface speed, which is currently at the lowest speed setting. The recommended fix as implemented by klusjesman also states that  you need to do two consecutive reads of a register within a single update time of the register, which is determined by the baud speed of the RF connection. Either way will work fine.

  I read back through the blog and really underestimated initially your contributions to solving the problems, Thanks!
