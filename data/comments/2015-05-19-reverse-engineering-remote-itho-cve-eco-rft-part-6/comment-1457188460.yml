body: "Hi Rogier, I bought this CC1101 http://www.ebay.com/itm/221950470081 with the antenna. The delivered antenna is about twice the length from the images so it might be a wrong one, but even then it should work with or without any antenna if I keep the module 10-15cm near the itho fan...\n\nThe CC1150 was delivered without antenna, but since it has wrong filters an antenna wouldn't do much.\nSo I held the CC1150 also very close to the itho fan, without result.\nEven the weakest signal just from the chip should be enough to cross a few cm, I suppose.\n\nToo bad I don't have any way of checking if there is any radio signal going out. I was thinking of using the cc1101 as receiver and the cc1150 as transmitter to test if they communicate at 868MHz (proving the 433MHz CC1150 does do something at 868MHz) but I really don't know how to code that.\n\nI have another 5V mega and a 5V uno, I can add resistors as voltage dividers to work at 3.3V with the CC module.  But then I still need some code to make a receiver on the CC1101 that can be used to test the range of the transmitting CC1150.  \n\nIf I had such code, I think it would also be possible to sniff my original RFT module for it's codes?\nThat might then be a nice option because then I don't even need to join anymore, because I can then use the codes from my RFT.\n\nIf it is of any use, here is what my current setup says (CC1150 should actually be CC1101 offcourse):\n\nsetup initializing...\nsetup done.\nRead registers: \nStatus registers\nCC1150_PARTNUM = 0\nCC1150_VERSION = 14\nCC1150_MARCSTATE = 1\nCC1150_PKTSTATUS = 0\nCC1150_VCO_VC_DAC = 94\nCC1150_TXBYTES = 0\n\nConfiguration registers\nCC1150_IOCFG1 = 2E\nCC1150_IOCFG0 = 3F\nCC1150_FIFOTHR = 7\nCC1150_SYNC1 = D3\nCC1150_SYNC0 = 91\nCC1150_PKTLEN = FF\nCC1150_PKTCTRL0 = 45\nCC1150_CHANNR = 0\nCC1150_FREQ2 = 1E\nCC1150_FREQ1 = C4\nCC1150_FREQ0 = EC\nCC1150_MDMCFG4 = 8C\nCC1150_MDMCFG3 = 22\nCC1150_MDMCFG2 = 2\nCC1150_MDMCFG1 = 22\nCC1150_MDMCFG0 = F8\nCC1150_DEVIATN = 47\nCC1150_MCSM1 = 30\nCC1150_MCSM0 = 4\nCC1150_FREND0 = 10\nCC1150_FSCAL3 = A9\nCC1150_FSCAL2 = A\nCC1150_FSCAL1 = 20\nCC1150_FSCAL0 = D\nCC1150_FSTEST = 59\nCC1150_PTEST = 7F\nCC1150_TEST2 = 88\nCC1150_TEST1 = 31\nCC1150_TEST0 = B\nEnd read registers.\nSend Register Device.\nsending join...\nrftCounter1 = 253\nrftCounter2 = 213\n170,170,170,173,51,83,45,75,82,178,170,171,85,84,211,84,170,171,85,75\n170,170,170,170,170,170,170,171,254,0,179,42,171,42,149,154,105,90,106,105,169,105,154,86,85,153,105,90,170,90,165,165,89,106,85,149,102,89,150,170,165,102,89,154,105,169,105,154,86,85,160\nsending join done.\nRegister done.\n\nDoes that look good?\n\nThere are some slight differences when I use the CC1150:\nsetup initializing...\nsetup done.\nRead registers: \nStatus registers\nCC1150_PARTNUM = 2\nCC1150_VERSION = 4\nCC1150_MARCSTATE = 1\nCC1150_PKTSTATUS = 2\nCC1150_VCO_VC_DAC = 94\nCC1150_TXBYTES = 0\n\nConfiguration registers\nCC1150_IOCFG1 = 2E\nCC1150_IOCFG0 = 3F\nCC1150_FIFOTHR = 7\nCC1150_SYNC1 = D3\nCC1150_SYNC0 = 91\nCC1150_PKTLEN = FF\nCC1150_PKTCTRL0 = 45\nCC1150_CHANNR = 0\nCC1150_FREQ2 = 1E\nCC1150_FREQ1 = C4\nCC1150_FREQ0 = EC\nCC1150_MDMCFG4 = C\nCC1150_MDMCFG3 = 22\nCC1150_MDMCFG2 = 12\nCC1150_MDMCFG1 = 22\nCC1150_MDMCFG0 = F8\nCC1150_DEVIATN = 47\nCC1150_MCSM1 = 0\nCC1150_MCSM0 = 8\nCC1150_FREND0 = 10\nCC1150_FSCAL3 = A9\nCC1150_FSCAL2 = A\nCC1150_FSCAL1 = 20\nCC1150_FSCAL0 = D\nCC1150_FSTEST = 57\nCC1150_PTEST = 7F\nCC1150_TEST2 = 0\nCC1150_TEST1 = 21\nCC1150_TEST0 = B\nEnd read registers.\nSend Register Device.\nsending join...\nrftCounter1 = 253\nrftCounter2 = 213\n170,170,170,173,51,83,45,75,82,178,170,171,85,84,211,84,170,171,85,75\n170,170,170,170,170,170,170,171,254,0,179,42,171,42,149,154,105,90,106,105,169,105,154,86,85,153,105,90,170,90,165,165,89,106,85,149,102,89,150,170,165,102,89,154,105,169,105,154,86,85,160\n\nDifferent values for MDMCFG4, MDMCFG2, MCSM1, MCSM0 (and some TEST values)."
