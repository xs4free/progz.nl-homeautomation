body: I have the same problem that with a Particle Photon device  the receive part of jimmy's code does not work, but it works fine on a Pro Mini 3.3V 8 MHz. Same code.  Reason unknown. So the arduino Nano might suffer from the same problem (SPI bus speed issue????), but  with your 3.3V pro mini it should work, I had the same configuration working. I also have two SPI devices connected to the Pro 3.3V and that works fine (a humidity sensor and the CC1101)
