body: "Hello Rogier,\n\nMy intention is to use the microphone to detect that the shower starts running and have that switch on the itho unit, i hate it to have to step from under the shower because i forgot to switch on the itho :).  You should be able to do that with an FFT analyzes of the signal and i found some libraries that can do that.  I know it's a crazy idea but it is fun so why not try it. and if i can't get it working i can always use the pcb to detect the shower light and and switch the ventilation on . \nDesigning your own board is not so dificult if you have the right program, this is a simple circuit and can be done on a two layer board. I ordered mine from the Elektor shop wich is Eurocircuits in Belgium, the offer you some good tools to check if your board can be produced by them and since i use them for my work also so i had no problems getting it through their checks and they delivered them in 7 days.\nAssembling the board could be difficult if you do not have the right tools, I assemble proto type boards for my work and have a soldering station with a 0.2mm tip and a lot of experience in soldering smd by hand, most of the components are 0603 so thats not a real problem. the only tricky part is the CC1150 and the antenna balun circuit, that uses 0402 and will be fun to do. I didn't want to change that because the TI circuit should be designed for an impedance of 50 ohms for the antenna and changing the layout of that will most likely change that.\n Another problem is getting the parts but except for the CC1150 everything i used can be ordered from Farnell (they sell to private persons with some restrictions) The CC1150 can be ordered in china. I have the boards and ordered the parts, I should have them before the 16th and then i can start assembling. \nI will let you know how it goes."
