  I decided not to play with the play with the SPI speed (otherwise it becomes hardware dependent).

  I implemented a readregister function that returns the median of 3 values.

  readRegisterMedian3

  This should reduce significantly the probability that incorrect values are read from a register, and at the same time should be (somewhat) save for reading e.g., the TX_BUFFER register that is continuously updated. It should be tolerant to reading no more than one incorrect value out of three.

  Updated the sendData subroutine with this change, and added jumping out of the subroutine in case of a TXFIFO_UNDERFLOW.

  I put a pull request to Klusjesman.

  I created a repository for the Arduino code:
