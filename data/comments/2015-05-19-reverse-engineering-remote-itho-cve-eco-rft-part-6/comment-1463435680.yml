  Dear Klusjesman,

  What still puzzles me is your BBuart.S file, specifically the port for serial communication. For the arduino project I had to make the following changes:

  In the BBuart.S file the port needed to be changed from PortC to PortD (serial port on the Pro Mini is on portD)

  The UART_TX needed to be changed from 0 to 1

  The UART_RX needed to be changed from 1 to 0

  The changed three lines in BBuart.S are below:


  #define UART_Port (PORTD-0x20)

  #define UART_Tx 1

  #define UART_Rx 0


  We both use the ATMega328P chip, in the data sheet the USART is given as:

  PD1: TXD (USART Output Pin) PCINT17 (Pin Change Interrupt 17)

  PD0: RXD (USART Input Pin) PCINT16 (Pin Change Interrupt 16)


  Are you sure that define UART_Port (PORTC-0x20)  is correct in your code, shouldn't it be PORTD?

  I am happy to change it on github, but if you tested it with PORTC i will leave it alone.
