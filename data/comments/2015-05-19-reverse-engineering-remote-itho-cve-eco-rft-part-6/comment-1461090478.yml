  Hi Klusjesman,


  Replying on this blog (it's not a forum) has a maximum depth of 5. A reply on a comment already at the 5th level will most likely just be added to the root level, so at the end of the comment section. I didn't write this blog software, it's just a default WordPress blog.


  I'm VERY interested in the code you are using to receive the commands (and most likely the other readers of this blog are interested as well). Could you please share the code somewhere on GitHub? Or else email the code to me at rogier(dot)reedijk(at)gmail(dot)com?


  If the code works when you are in the same room, but doesn't work if you are in another room, it sound like either the antenna or there is more noice being received and the CC1101 is set to sensitive (I think Jimmy talked about a register setting for sensitivity in the comments).
