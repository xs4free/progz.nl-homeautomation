  Klusjesman, what exactly do you mean with that register problem? A while ago I only noticed a difference in the 'default' settings between my cc1101 and cc1105, but those were the values before the code changed them.  Now I took my newest cc1101 and verified the values after the setupRF() and setupRFT() functions and I don't see a problem there.  The only strange thing is that the code has a lot of different values for registers like MDMCFG4 and a few others, like:

  ITHO_RF_MDMCFG4	0x07

  ITHO_RFT1_MDMCFG4 0x08

  ITHO_RFT2_MDMCFG4 0x0A

  And even in the code it is set: cc1150.writeRegister(CC1150_MDMCFG4 ,0x08);

  So it is very unclear why and where what value is the correct value.

  But as far as I just tested, I do see the registers being set.


  So perhaps you can explain when/where/how you see a register not being set, so I can try to reproduce it with my 3 different boards?
