body: "Hi Rogier,\n(too bad we live about 45mn apart, which is a bit too far for just bringing my itho rft module and/or cc11xx modules to you for testing/developing)\n\nWhile playing with the mentioned tx/rx code on the cc1150 for TX and cc1101 for RX, I tried to match as much values as possible.\nThe settings for pleamble/sync (SYNC_MODE), Serial mode (PKT_FORMAT), infinite packet length (LENGTH_CONFIG) gave problems, but I'm sure changing those settings will also need the code to be changed for that. \nSame for the GDO0 config in GDO0_CFG, this would also need a code change when switching to a different value.\n\nBut I confirmed (more or less) that all other settings should at least transmit something. (I'm still don't have radio-hardware to \"see\" if your code transmits here with my modules)\n\nA tip for you when creating RX code, change CHANBW to higher values, with both zeroes for CHANBW_E and CHANBW_M (tightest filter) I had no communication between my modules.\n\nI'm not able to create code for the serial-mode, but I think this can be very useful:\nhttps://github.com/fullTalgoRythm/EvohomeWirelessFW\nIn the ino file I see sync_clk_in() connected to the GDO2 interrupt, where GDO2 is the clock and GDO0 is the data."
