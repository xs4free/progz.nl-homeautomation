  Hi Rogier,

  I am very far along reverse engineering the ELRO alarm system HA68.

  I can read the messages from the door sensors, the smoke alarm, the entry keys and the motion sensors. Was quite some work figuring out the CC1101 settings to intercept the messages.

  Any interest in this info on maybe a separate project page?
