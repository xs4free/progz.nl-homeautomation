  I also have the boards with half plated holes. I was having some problems soldering pins on them. The biggest problem is the spacing is too small so connecting breadboard wiring to the pins is difficult.


  I ordered some boards from aliexpress which are prepared for arduino. They just have some pins and antenna soldered on them.
