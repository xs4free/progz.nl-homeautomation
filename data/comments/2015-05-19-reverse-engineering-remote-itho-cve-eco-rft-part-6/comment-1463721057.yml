  Thanks JFDB,

  After starting my Github version again, now as a Fork instead of a Copy/Clone, I have tested my code on an ESP8266 and it works fine.

  I am using your Median3 part, so that also works.

  As you noticed, my code is a bit more compact (I think less complicated if someone wants to start with it) because I use more default Arduino libraries. That also made it easier for me to make it also work on an ESP8266 module. Working with an ESP8266 is easy. Compared to tha Arduino Pro, it has a faster processor (80MHz), more RAM (64k), and most of all it has WiFi.  Because it can be used from the Arduino IDE with Arduino code, it's very easy to use for people who are familiar with the Arduino. A possible disadvantage is that it has less IO pins available (depending on the model).  It's 3.3V and it's as cheap as an Arduino.  :)  (this starts to sound as tell-sell)


  Because the ESP8266 handles things like wifi on the background, code could be a bit more complicated. Any function should either return very fast or call a yield() regularly, otherwise a watchdog timeout will occur. That is why you may find the yield() calls in some while-loops.  (The yields do no harm when running on an Arduino)
