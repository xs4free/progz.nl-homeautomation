  Hi Klusjesman,


  I looked at the remote i have and i am sure that Itho is using the internal oscillator for the communication.

  They use a ATMega 169PV and this chip has a maximum clock speed of 8 MHz according to the data sheet so it can't handle 26 MHz. Also the only connection they have to the xtal pins of the 169PV is to a pull up resistor with a testpoint to enable testing during production. So they must be using both internal oscillators of the 169PV and the CC1150 to get things working.

  The CC1101 and CC1150 also have internal calibrtion circuits for the RF frequency and that must be done after power on and sleep modes so that makes it reliable enough.

  You could use a seperate 26 MHz oscillator to feed both your processor and the CC1101/CC1150 but i don't think that this would make it more reliable.

  The oscillator in the CC1101/1150 is also not designed to power an external circuit so you can't use it to clock your processor
