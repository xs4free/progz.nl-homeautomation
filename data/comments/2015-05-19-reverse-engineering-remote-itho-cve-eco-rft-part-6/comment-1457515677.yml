  Hi all,

  Thanks for the great info. i am planning on this as well, ordered the cc1101 see howit works out.

  I do have one remark for Jimmy, though it might have been obvious: the itho unit wanted me to active the remote after installation by pressing two diagonal buttons I think. I would say, after building, you need to do this as well. Could that be the reason for the unit not responding to the commands?
