  Hi Leon,

  Jimmys github code is simple to understand.

  The setup loop tries to register the arduino device as a remote with the fan.

  The loop loop just monitors communication to the tho fan.

  If you want it to send a commend, just insert the code
   sendFullSpeed();
  at the end of the loop() loop

  But since the arduino runs this loop multiple times per second, it is better to include a delay statement, like
   sendFullSpeed();
  delay(100000); //this delays by 100 seconds

  All is functional when your fan speeds up to full speed when you run this code
