  Hi Guys,

  Thanks for the great Job you've done.

  I bought the hardware on Aliexpress for under 5€ and can control my fan via Internet now!

  What i am missing is a way to switch the fan off completly. I suspect the fan controller does have a command for that but it was obviously not discoverd till now.

  Does anyone have an Idea?
