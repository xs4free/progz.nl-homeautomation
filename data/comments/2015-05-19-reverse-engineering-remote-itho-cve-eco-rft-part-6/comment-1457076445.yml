body: '...Oh, and in addidion: I now replaced the 433MHz-filtered CC1150 with a 868MHz-filtered CC1101, but the results look exactly the same.  It reads the registers successfully so communication between Arduino and CC module looks fine. It also seems to send commands to the modules, but the itho does not respond to the register command (within a few sec after removing power from the itho and powering on again).'
