  I am running with a 14.7456MHz crystal. The SPI connection is set up at a low speed (SPI::Init). You can try to increase the SPI speed to see if it solves the problem.


  "What I don not like about the fix is that it is not robust." It is not really related with the fix but with the way the send function is working for messages bigger than 64 bytes. The status is already retrieved so it would be easy to add some extra checks to check for overflow/underflow. There can also be a short timeout on the function.
