body: "I managed to get everything working using klusjesman code. (well, I have not joined yet but I can receive the wireless communication, see example below)\nMy setup is an Arduino ATmega328P Pro Mini 3.3V 8 MHz and a CC1101 board from eBay (China).\nThe compiler is Arduino 1.6.9 on a Mac (I upgraded from 1.6.0 and got rid of a few error messages)\nI was struggling a lot with the assembler code, but I managed to fix it.\nThe changes I needed to make were:\nIn the BBuart.S file the port needed to be changed from PortC to PortD (serial port on the Pro Mini is on portD)\nThe UART_TX needed to be changed from 0 to 1\nThe UART_RX needed to be changed from 1 to 0\nThe changed three lines in BBuart.S are below:\n\n#define UART_Port (PORTD-0x20)\n#define UART_Tx 1\n#define UART_Rx 0\n\nFurhtermore I needed to change the int main(void) to void loop() in the main program\nSee two lines below in the main program:\n\n//int main(void)\nvoid loop()\n\nThe BBuart.h and BBuart.S file were placed in a directory BBuart in the libraries directory of the arduino directory tree.\nAll other files were placed in the directory with the main program (and the include statements were updated in all the files so all files could be found in the directory with the main program, except for the BBuart library, that was included with \n#include    \n(note the  in stead of the quotes)\n\nTime to press some buttons on the remote, the result for a full press is below:\n\ntest_serOut\nsend\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\nmessage1 not ok=byte6 (74/51)\nmessage1 not ok=byte7 (170/43)\nmessage1 not ok=byte8 (179/84)\nmessage1 not ok=byte9 (53/205)\nmessage1 not ok=byte14 (211/203)\nmessage2 not ok=byte16 (105/101)\nmessage2 not ok=byte17 (169/89)\nmessage2 not ok=byte18 (102/154)\nmessage2 not ok=byte19 (165/153)\nmessage2 not ok=byte21 (169/105)\nmessage2 not ok=byte41 (106/102)\nmessage2 not ok=byte42 (90/170)\nmessage2 not ok=byte43 (166/90)\nmessage2 not ok=byte49 (160/170)\ncounter=49, full\ntest_serOut\nsend\n\nRogier and Klusjesman, awesome job putting this together, thanks a lot.\nNow I need to find out what the meaning is of the message1 not OK and message2 not ok messages.\nAny tips are greatly appreciated!"
