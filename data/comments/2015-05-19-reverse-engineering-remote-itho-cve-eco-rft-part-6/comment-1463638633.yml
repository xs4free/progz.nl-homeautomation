  Hi André,  an Arduino or ESP8266 together with a CC1101 cost about 7 euros (perhaps +3 euros, if the Arduino/ESP doesn't have serial yet), while the jeelink costs 32,50 euro.

  Beside the price, how would you add things like a few buttons and a CO2 sensor to it?


  If you choose to use an RPi with a CC1101, it should be "relatively easy" to port the code, since rPI also supports SPI:

  AFAIK the RPi is also 3.3V which makes connecting the CC1101 to the RPi easy too.

  All you will have to do is write RPi code that does the same as the code from Rogier and Klusjesman...


  If you want to use a different radio-chip like that jeelink's RFM69CW, you will need to figure out how to make that chip send the same bits with the same speed at the same frequency with the same modulation as we do now with the CC1101.  Since it is 'exactly known' what is sent, you can to tell the chip to do the same.


  Why don't you just buy your own Arduino+CC1101 for a few euros?  :)
