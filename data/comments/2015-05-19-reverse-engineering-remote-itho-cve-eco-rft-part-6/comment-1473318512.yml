  Dear Leon,

  You do not need to search for your ID.

  Jimmy has posted pretty good code on github, I would use that.

  It also registers an ID with your fan so it will listen to the commands you send.

  You only need to do that once using the Join(). In Jimmy s code this command is run standard at startup.

  You need to unplug and replug the eco fan, then it listens for 2 minutes for a possible join command.

  You need a CC1101 module and a unit that can run arduino code (like ESP8266 or Arduino pro mini or something alike) and solder the commections between the arduino processor and the CC1101.

  Good luck

  JFdB
