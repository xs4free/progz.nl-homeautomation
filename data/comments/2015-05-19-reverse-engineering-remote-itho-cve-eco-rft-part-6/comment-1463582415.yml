body: "Jimmy,\n\nFor my own project I will use my original readRegisterWithSyncProblem since this is what TI is recommending and is also working nicely on my Atmega. When the readRegisterWithSyncProblem function is giving problems it means you are running into the SPI sync bug a lot (=unreliable read result). I rather like solving the real problem instead of implementing a work around. \n\nI will only include the underflow check. But there are some other checks I will add (when I have time). There is one more bug in the CC1101 which needs to be addressed in the code. Also I will increase the SPI speed because it is running at the lowest speed. At least the speed can be doubled."
