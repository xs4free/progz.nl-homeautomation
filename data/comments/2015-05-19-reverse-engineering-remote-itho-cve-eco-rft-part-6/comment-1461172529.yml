body: "I am stuck.  After more than tripple checking, I am sure all things like RFT_Id, headers, footers, commands, and fixed bits and bytes match exactly the \"low\" message with my RFT.\nThe only difference is within both the counter1 and counter2 of the second message.\nBut when I press medium on the RTF and then low on the Arduino/cc1101, nothing happens.  (not even when I press it many times)\n\n@Klusjesman, in reply to your question:\n>>  \"It would be nice btw, if we can compare some more messages from different remotes to find out what all the bytes represent.\" \nI can supply them for a \"low\" message in plain text format.\nMy code matches my RFT exactly for the first part of the message, so I can give you those specific lines of code.\nThe second part of the message contains 2 counters and therefor does not match exactly.\nI can supply my manual work (RF to human)  in binary (11001100 01010101 11110000 etc) and decimal values.\nBut I don't want to place my RFT_Id on the internet, for privacy reasons."
