  Hi Jimmy,


  Just a short update, I've actually started working on the receiving code. But I haven't had enough time to finish the code, let alone test the code. I've been very busy lately, so haven't had as much time for this hobby as I would like.

  I'm curious which CC1101 boards you actually have ordered? Do you have a link for me?

  The board I recently ordered arrived, but has half plated holes and not the regular 0.1inch spacing between the holes, so connecting this board to a breadboard is going to be difficult (at least with my current soldering skills).


  As soon as I've had some more time to work on the code, I will let you know.


  Regards, Rogier.
