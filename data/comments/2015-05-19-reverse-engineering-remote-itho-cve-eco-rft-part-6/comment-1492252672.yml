body: "Hi Rick,\n\nIn theory you should be able to control the Itho with any 868MHz RF transmitter. So the Aurel transceiver could also work.\n \nThe challenge however, will be to write the code to sent the correct data using the specific commands for the Aurel. \n\nThe people on this blog that successfully controlled the Itho all used (nearly) the same chipset that Itho is using. This way it's easier to send the exact same data. \n\nThe code people have posted and used on my blog can help you decipher the protocol and maybe create an implementation for the Aurel. But it will definitely take you some time. So it's not a easy as copying the code found on this site. \n\nIf you do get it working, please let us know!"
