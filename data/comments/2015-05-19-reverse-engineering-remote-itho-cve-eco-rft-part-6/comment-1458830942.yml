  Here's my latest "news". Until now I was using a 5V Arduino and 5V/3.3V level shifters. Because I was not completely sure that I had never made any 5V/3.3V mistake, I ordered a new 3.3V Arduino Pro and a new CC1101 module. These are powered from my USB-FTDI Serial module which is also set to 3.3V. I checked Vcc, which is roughly 3.3V.  But sadly the itho still does not respond to the join() function.


  But at least I now have a CC1101 with an Arduino Pro at 3.3V and a CC1101 with a 'normal' Arduino and level shifters.

  Those 2 sets could be helpful if anyone manages to create some listening/receiving code.
