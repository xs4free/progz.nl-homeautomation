body: "My code is not excluding buttons, you can just use any way you want to send any signal.\nIf you want to use buttons, you can do something like in Rogier's code.\nIf you want the speed to be controlled by any sensor, you can use any code to read the sensor and send a command depending on the reading of the sensor.\n\nFor example, you are using an analog CO2 sensor. \nWhen the sensor gives an analogRead value of 200 you want to send the Full. \nThen you can add code to your loop like:\nint a = analogRead(A0);\nif (a99) && (a200) sendFullSpeed();\n\nJust be creative.  \n(and make sure you are not sending a command every time your loop() runs, otherwise it will send almost continously)"
