  Hi Rogier,


  Thanks for your very interesting blog! I would love to experiment with the components & software you provide, but cannot find an 868 MHz CC1150 module, only an 433 MHz one (which, from the photo, looks exactly like the one on your blog). Do you have any suggestions? Is the 433 MHz module easily reconfiguarble to 868 MHz?


  Thanks & best regards,


  Hans.
