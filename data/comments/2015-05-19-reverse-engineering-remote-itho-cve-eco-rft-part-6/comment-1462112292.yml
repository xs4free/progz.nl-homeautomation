  I am able to control my ventilation using the CC1101 without any problems. The Itho remote and my own remote are working together at the same time, using the same id's. At the moment my leave implementation does not work. Join and leave have different sized messages, also compared to the normal commands. I am using FIFO for sending and receiving and this is working fine. I did not test the join command yet. When the join and leave commands are working everybody should be able to control their Itho ventilation using my code.


  It is not possible to just put your own device id into my code because it will not work without making some changes to the calculations of the counter bytes.
