body: I am able to receive RF signals from the Itho remote! I only have been working on the first message (20 bytes). The data looks like the data retrieved using the analyzer. It only looks like a mess on receiving because I am just outputting everything I receive. But at least I am getting somewhere. Now I have to parse the data nicely. But first I will do some more investigating in ways to receive data and detect packages, etc.
