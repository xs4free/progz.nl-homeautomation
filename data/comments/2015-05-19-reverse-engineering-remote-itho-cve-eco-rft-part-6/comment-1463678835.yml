body: "Hi JFDB,  a couple of weeks ago I decided to switch from Rogier's code to Klusjesman's code. It was not very hard to change his code to Arduino-compatible code, because I dropped his UART and SPI code and started to use the Arduino IDE built-in Serial and SPI.\nTo make a long story short, I got it all working, including the Join.  \n\nI am a bit surprised that you run into a lot of problems around the join.  I am using a 3.3V 8MHz Arduino Pro too,  so that shouldn't be the problem. Only during all the testing and changing, while I am not very experienced, my code became too different from Klusjesman to put it on github.\n\nYesterday I went back to his current code (including ome parts from you, like the readRegisterMedian3) and changed it to Arduino code like I did before.  I must say that I have now only checked it it compiles without errors. So I have not really tested it on my Arduino/CC1101/RFT yet.  Because of that, I am not sure if it works fine with your Median3 and your final check if trransmission is finished.  Now I understand from Klusjesman is only using your final check and not your Median3 part. I must say that I think that I will go back to the readRegisterWithProblem from Klusjesman, simply because I know from experience that it works fine.\nI hope I will have time to test the code that I have on github now.\n\nSpeaking about Github, I now read that it should have been possible to make a fork instead of a copy?\nI thought that klusjesman got messages about every change that I make to a fork, but I now read that I can so something like a pull request only for what I think that is relevant for him?\nIf so, my current github copied project will soon be replaced by a forked project."
