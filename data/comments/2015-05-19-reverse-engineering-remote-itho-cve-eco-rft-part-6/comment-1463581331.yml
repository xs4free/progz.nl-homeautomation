  Why are you using seperate rf and controller boards?

  There are Jeelabs usb sticks available that are all in one!

  I have both types, the Classic and the V3c with RFM12b or RFM69CW 868MHz transceivers and an AT328 on board.

  These sticks are handy when using a Raspberry Pi or even a Windows pc.

  Is it possible for someone to port the code so that it can work with a Rpi?

  The only thing needed is serial comms with the usb port as far as I understand.
