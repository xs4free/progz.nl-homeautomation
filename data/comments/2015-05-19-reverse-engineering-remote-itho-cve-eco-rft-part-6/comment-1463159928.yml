body: "Wow! Good find JFDB!\nAccording to the errata data sheet a different solution would be to listen to the threshold interrupt on a GDO pin. This sounds do-able but on the other hand, we only have to sent one join successfully and all the other messages fit in one buffer. So this sounds like to much hassle to actually fix using the interrupt. Your solution is more than adequate!\n \nThe official \"GitHub-way\" of submitting a fix is indeed creating a fork, doing the fix in your fork and then sending a Pull Request to Klusjesman to include your fork in his repo. To speed things up and make a fixed version available I've created a fork of Klusjesman's repo under my own GitHub account and changed the line you suggested:\nhttps://github.com/xs4free/IthoEcoFanRFT\nI have also created a Pull Request from this fork back to Klusjesman: \nhttps://github.com/Klusjesman/IthoEcoFanRFT/pull/1\nAs soon as he accepts this Pull Request your change should be visible in his repository as well.\n\nI'm planning on doing a new blogpost with a write-up of everything that was added in the comments on this blogpost. So that everyone can find the working sources at Klusjesman's repo. I might also update my own sources to match Klusjesman's code. I'm planning on using his code on an ESP8266 and adding the MQTT-protocol to signal speed changes and accept new speeds.\n\nWhen I started with this project I never expected so much interest from other people and I'm very happy with all the work everyone (Klusjesman especially!) contributed. This is a great way to create a nice working solution together!"
