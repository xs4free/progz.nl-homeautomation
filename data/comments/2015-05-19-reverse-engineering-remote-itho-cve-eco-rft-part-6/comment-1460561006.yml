  With a bit of shame I must confess that I have now returned to the original library files and now I do see TX from the Arduino/cc1101 at 868.x MHz.

  Probably next thing is to find out if it is possible to determine why the itho does not respond by doing something with what I can receive/capture?

  We may need to compare the original rtf tx with the arduino tx.

  Anyone has experience with handling the data that I can see now?  From SDRSharp or rtl_sdr.exe I can extract a WAV (or I/Q) file.


  It could be just a calibration-issue with the rtl-sdr or the software, but I noticed that the RFT and cc1101 transmissions are at about 868.284671MHz, instead of 868.299865MHz.

  They are both at (nearly) the same frequency, that won't be any problem.


  Comparing the captured waves, I do see big simmilarities and small differences in the structure.

  3 sessions, each consisting of 2 parts.

  The first part on the RFT is 0.038mS, on the CC1101 about 0.034mS.  (may be measuring tollerance)

  The 3 session together on the FRT 0.237mS, on the CC1101 only 0.188mS. Looks like a difference.

  The first and second part seem to have a different encoding, but they are the same kind of encoding on RFT and CC1101.

  The waves from the RFT are very clear, from the CC1101 they are somewhat distorted.

  All above does not really look like the reason, it's only details.


  If anyone is interested, I can post the 2 files somewhere. A simple wavetool like Audacity helped me looking at this detail.

  (thanks to the guy from the earlier mentioned Zigbee me Decoding itho RF Protocol blog, who pointed at that tool)


  I think I can see/recognise the bits as ones and zeroes in the waveforms.

  But it is (nearly) impossible to compare all bits by hand.  :(

  Anyone know some tool for that?
