  Hi Rogier and Klusjesman,

  The last one I ordered was this type of board: http://www.ebay.com/itm/381475961886

  The first one was: http://www.ebay.com/itm/221950470081

  On the pictures they look like they have complete holes, but they are only half holes.

  (Because the first one came with a (taller) 433MHz antenna while 868MHz was printed on the board, I don't really trust it's filters. I cut the antenna to be more 868MHz compatible but I'm still not confident that the filter components are correct.)


  You're right that they are not breadboard-friendly, so I just soldered 8 of those cheap breadboard wires to the cc1101 half-holes. Being lazy, I let the metal pins on the wires and soldered those pins to the board. Seems to be working just fine.

  Now I can connect the cc1101 via the wires directly to the breadboard position that I want (power and the arduino pins).


  So currently I have a cc1150 with 433MHz filters, and 2 cc1101's with (hopefully) 868MHz filters, all with breadboard wires.

  I can use them with one Arduino Pro mini @3.3V and one Arduino Nano @5V with level-shifters: http://www.avrfreaks.net/comment/1362181#comment-1362181

  If needed I also have an Arduino Mega2560 @5V, but that is totally different at SPI, or I can borrow my son's Arduino UNO @5V. Only for those I need to add more level shifters ofcourse.


  If there is anything(...) that I can do to help, please let me know.
