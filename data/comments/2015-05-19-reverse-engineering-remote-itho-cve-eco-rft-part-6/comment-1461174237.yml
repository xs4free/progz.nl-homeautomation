  About privacy regarding the device id. I don't think they are using an unique device id for every remote because they are tied to the 2 bits sequence restriction (at least it looks like it). So this would mean they cannot generate any number and I am wondering whether there are enough possibilities available to make unique numbers for all remotes. But maybe there is.


  One other thing I am thinking about is the two messages they are sending on different data rates. The Itho RFT is set up with the data rate of the second message. It will be possible to get the bits from both messages with those settings. But maybe they are only using the second message. The first message could be there for other/older systems Itho delivers.
