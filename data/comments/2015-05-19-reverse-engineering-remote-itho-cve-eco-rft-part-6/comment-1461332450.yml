  I am finished with my code to parse the incoming messages, it is on github. At the same time I made functions which are doing the opposite for sending.


  I only have 1 counter in my code. It is a byte (0-255). It is just incremented on every button press. All 6 counter bytes are derived from this single counter. I have tested the code using a database containing thousands of RF message data and it all works fine.


  There are the following commands:

  - join, leave

  - low, medium, full

  - timer1, timer2, timer3 (when you press the timer button 3 times quickly it will send a message on every press = timer1, timer2 and timer3 command)


  The code contains a function to get the counter value out of the first 3 counter bytes in the message. And there are functions to generate the 6 bytes out of the counter value for sending.


  I guess the unknown bytes which are left are all for the device id.
