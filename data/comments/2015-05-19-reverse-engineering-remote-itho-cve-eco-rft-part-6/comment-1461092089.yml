body: "Hey Jimmy!\n\nIt is logical that the counters differ between the Arduino and the original Itho remote. My code just starts the counter at an arbitrary number and decreases the counter number on every message. \nAs far as I've seen the Itho box isn't expecting numbers to be a nice lineair set. The only restriction I've found is that sending the exact same message (with the same counter values) doesn't seem to work.\n\nLooking back at my own code, I see that the low-command for both the remotes I tested with (ITHO_REMOTE1 and the ELSE block) are different. So I'm not really surprised that the low-command from your remote is also different. The question remains what those last 2/3 bytes mean. It could be yet another identifier for the remote...\nOn the other hand, my remotes should actually work with your ventilation box (as long as the remote is joined). So as long as the message contains the values the Itho box is expecting, it shouldn't matter which identifier the Arduino uses.\n\nIt sound like you are very close to getting it working yourself! It sounds like there is just a very small difference in the message that you haven't found yet. Keep up the good work and do let us know if you make any progress.\n\nAs soon as I find the time I will continue working on my own receive code and upload it to GitHub. And then I should buy an actual Itho ventilation box so I can actually test my code again in my new house. ;-)"
