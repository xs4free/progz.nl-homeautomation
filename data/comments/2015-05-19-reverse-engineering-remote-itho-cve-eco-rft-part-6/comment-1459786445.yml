body: "Hi Ed,\n\nThanks for sharing the pcb! I'm very curious what your project will be doing besides controlling the Itho, because I see you added a microphone input?\nMy future goal is to make my own pcb as well. I didn't think about using the reference design from Texas Instruments, that's a very good tip!\nThe only thing stopping me from spinning up my own pcb right now is that all components are smd components. How are you going to mount the components when you get the boards? In the past I did some research on a reflow hot plate, but never got around to actually buying one.\n\nPlease do keep us posted on the progress you make. I will be following your GitHub repo. \nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask here or sent me an email at rogier(dot)reedijk(at)gmail(dot)com."
