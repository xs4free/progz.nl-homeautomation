body: I am working on some code for the CC1101 to be able to send and receive data. I have a few 868 prints. According the CC1101 datasheet a clock signal of 26MHz is required for the 868 range. The Itho print contains a 26MHz crystal. The only thing I don't know is where the ATMega169pv is getting its clock signal from since the max supported clock is 20MHz. Currently I am running at 14.7MHz. I will order some 26MHz crystals.
