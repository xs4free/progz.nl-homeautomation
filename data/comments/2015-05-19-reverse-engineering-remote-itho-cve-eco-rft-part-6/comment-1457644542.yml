body: "Hi Jimmy, \n\nThanks for all your feedback until now! It is really motivating me to look at my code again.\n\nI've also found and used the same code you found. Sadly that code will not work with the Itho, because of 2 reasons:\n1) the code uses the packet mode, instead of the serial-communication mode for the CC1101 and CC1150\n2) each packet is surrounded by preamble and a sync-word. This is extra data that the Itho ventilation-unit isn't expecting.\n\nIf you read chapter 27 \"Asynchronous and Synchronous Serial Operation\" of the CC1101 datasheet, the different serail modes are explained. Within my code I'm using the Synchronous Serial Operation with all the extra features DISABLED. That is the only way the Itho ventilationbox will accept data.\n\nI'm currently doing some research how hard it is going to be to implement a receive method that scans for the remote-id. I think I will be able to write one, but it's going to be even harder to test this method, since I currently don't have an Itho remote control. So I'm probably going to do the same setup you created (an CC1150 transmitting Itho codes, and a CC1101 receiving/listing for the remote id). I've I make any progress I will write a new blogpost or add it to the comments (and share my code on GitHub)."
