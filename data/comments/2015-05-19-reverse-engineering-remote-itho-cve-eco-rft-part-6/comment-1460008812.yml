  (klusjesman, I cannot comment on your latest post, so I add it here)

  When my cc1101 starts, DEVIATN reads 47.

  After setupRF() is reads 40 and after setupRFT() it reads 50.  This is how the code sends it, so those readings are correct.


  When I change the code to use the FREQ alues that you mention, I read after that:

  CC1150_FREQ2 = 21

  CC1150_FREQ1 = 62

  CC1150_FREQ0 = 76

  FREQ0 is not changed to 0xEC like on your board.


  Then I swapped my cc1101 with my other cc1101 and then with my cc1150, they all work fine with those registers.

  FYI, I just use the AllFourButtons code with the libraries from Rogier. I changed the register values in the itho.h file and added printRegisters() to Itho::sendCommand after setupRF() and after setupRFT().
