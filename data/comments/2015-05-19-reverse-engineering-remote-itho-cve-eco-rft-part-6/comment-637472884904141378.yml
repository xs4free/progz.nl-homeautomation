But looking at the message2 structure something looked odd with those counter and command bytes shifted over partial bytes.
Isn't this actually 10bit symbols going over the air to pack 8bit bytes? If you count 10bits after the 16bit sync word (?) 255 and 0 (ie.1111111100000000) there is a regular pattern of "10" before every 8bits (or the 8 bits are preceded by a "start" bit of a 1 and succeeded by a "stop" bit of a 0). 
This would shift all the counter and command bytes into whole bytes.... Need to look into this further but it looks like a form of 10bit encoding with DC balance (just as many 0s as 1s go over the 'line')"
