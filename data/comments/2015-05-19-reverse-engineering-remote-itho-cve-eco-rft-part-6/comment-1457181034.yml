  Hey Jimmy,


  Sad to hear the code isn't immediately working for you. A simple check, have you attached an actual antenna to the CC1101? Most modules from eBay are just the board and don't contain an onboard antenna. You can find the antenna's on eBay as well: http://r.ebay.com/Jy6hH7


  I've also ordered an CC1101 868MHz board and I am waiting for it to arrive.


  Do you by any change have an SDR dongle? (Software Defined Radio dongle) This way you can actually check that the CC1101 is actually broadcasting data over RF. (sadly the dongle won't give you more information than that). Because I'm still not 100% sure the existing code will work with the CC1101, since it was designed for the CC1150.


  In my previous house I didn't test the join-function, because I used the same ID as the remote I already had. So the current implementation of the join function is based on the codes I recorded from my remote. Looking at the code I don't see a reason why it wouldn't work. Within a month or 2 I will probably install a new Itho ventilation unit in my new home and then I can directly test the join-code on my new Itho.


  I will also be looking at the suggestion from Erwin about listening/monitoring current transmission and extracting the remote ID from those messages. That might make this code easier to use.


  The code currently on Github worked for me, but it isn't foolproof. The commenters on this blog are the first people to actually test the code on a different ventilation unit, so there are bound to be some errors in the code. Keep sending me feedback and do try some experiments your self. I (and the other people reading this blog) would love to hear your progress.
