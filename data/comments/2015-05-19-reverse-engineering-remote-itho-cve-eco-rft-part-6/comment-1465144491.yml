body: "Hey JFDB,\n\nSounds like a lot of work! Off course I'm interested in the code. But don't you want to put the code on your own blog? (easily created for free at www.WordPress.com for instance) Or else create a project page on www.Hackaday.io? This way more people will find your project and code. "
