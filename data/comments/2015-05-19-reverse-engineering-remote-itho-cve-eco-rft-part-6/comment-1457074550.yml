body: Same problem here with the ebay cc1150, it looks like sending join (and the other codes when pressing the buttons), but the itho does not respond. I know I have a 433MHz version, just like ERWIN, but that's only a difference in the antanna filters (making transmission range on 868MHz bad). When I hold the cc1150 right next to the itho it still does not work.
