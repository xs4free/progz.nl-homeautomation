body: "Hey Klusjesman,\n\nThe 26MHz is indeed the oscillator (crystal) needed by the CC1101 (and CC1150). Every ATMega microcontroller has it's own internal oscillator. So you don't have to connect your own oscillator to get started. The internet is full of stories about the internal oscillators of the ATMega microcontrollers. Most of them say the aren't very accurate and that if you want to do high speed serial communication (as an example) then you need a seperate oscillator. \nIf you look at the designs for the Arduino boards, you will notice all Arduino boards have a seperate oscillator. So if you are creating your own board, it is probably wise to use a seperate oscillator as well.\n\nRegards, Rogier."
