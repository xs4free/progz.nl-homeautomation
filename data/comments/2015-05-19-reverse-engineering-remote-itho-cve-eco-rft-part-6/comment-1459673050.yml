body: "Hello Rogier,\n\nThis is a very interesting project.\nI recently replaced my old ventilation unit by an Itho unit also and decided that i wanted to add my own controller with some\nspecial functionality to control it as an add-on for the 2 remotes i have.\nWithout your project I might not have started because the protocol for the unit is not available but with your code i should be able to get\nmy own controller working.\nAs everybody found out already 868 MHz transmitters are not available, you could use a 433 MHz board but then you will have to replace the \ninductors and capaciitors for the antenna circuit because the 433 MHz version will lower the output signal so much that the range will be\nvery small (if it works) . So i decided to make my own pcb based upon the demo boards of Texas Instruments.\nI work as a hardware designer and i could import the Texas Instruments designs without a problem, then i added my own processor\nand some other stuff i will need in the future.\nThe board design is in production now and i will receive the finished pcb's next week. I will order the parts also so i hope i can start assembling the boards soon and start with writing firmware when the processor part is running.\nI posted the schematics and a picture of the pcb on github : https://github.com/EdvanRijn/Itho-controller\n\nI will let you know how it goes\n\nregards,\nEd van Rijn"
