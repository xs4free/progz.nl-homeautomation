  I moved away from sync and async communication. I decided to try packet control on the CC1101 and it works perfectly. I set up the registers for FIFO, sync bytes and fixed packet length. Now it becomes easy to receive both messages from the remote control. I will make a simple parser to distinguish the different button commands and get the device ID.


  The only thing I have to investigate is the reception. When I press the remote when I am in a different room it doesn't work anymore. But maybe this is due to the antenna on the CC1101.
