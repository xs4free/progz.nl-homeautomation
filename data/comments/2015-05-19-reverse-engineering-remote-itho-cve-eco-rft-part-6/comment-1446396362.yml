body: "Hi Hans,\n\nI've quickly searched eBay and AliExpress for a CC1150 at 868MHz, but could not find any. I've read the datasheet thoroughly and there is a difference between the 868 MHz and the 433 MHz boards, the difference is in the resistors between the CC1150 and the antenna. As I see it, you have a couple of options:\n1) use the CC1150 433 MHz board and just try it. \n2) use a CC1101 868 MHz board and adjust my code. You can buy this board on eBay, for example: http://r.ebay.com/HiXi4a\n3) try to approach a Chinese seller that sells the CC1150 433 MHz boards and ask if they also have the 868 MHz boards\n\nI can't look at your budget, but I would try options 1 and 2 in parallel. Order both boards and see which arrives first. Worst case for option 1 is that the fan won't respond because the signal does not get through. Option 2 entails looking up the register differences between the CC1150 and the CC1101. Since both chips share the same datasheet this should not be too hard. The only difference between the CC1150 and the CC1101 is that the CC1101 also has the abillity to listen to RF, the CC1150 is send-only.\n\nOption 2 has been on my todo-list for a while. I haven't gotten around to it, because I'm in the process of moving to a different house. So sadly I currently have no time to tinker with electronics. \n\nLet me know which option you choose and if you have any questions, just ask! I will try to help you any way I can."
