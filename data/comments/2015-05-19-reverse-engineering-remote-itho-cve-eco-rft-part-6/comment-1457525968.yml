  Today a few other tests and results.

  I have setup a tx/tx test between my 433MHz version cc1150 (tx) and 868MHz cc1101 (rx).

  This code helped me: http://labalec.fr/erwan/?p=497  (modified to use 868MHz)

  It is possible to send/receive at a short distance of a few meters with no antenna on the cc1150 and a a antenna on the cc1101.

  After searching, I also found that the antenna delivered with the cc1101 is not for 868MHz but 433MHz: https://github.com/OpenHR20/OpenHR20/wiki/2.1)--433-MHz-and-868-MHz--Antenna-Design-Examples


  I have now cut this antenna in 2 pieces, so I have a better antenna on the cc1101 and the cutted piece is just enough for an antenna on the cc1150.

  As to be expected with the 433MHz filters on my cc1150 board, range is still limited to a few meters.


  But at least I proved that it is possible to send data on 868MHz wih the cc1150/433MHz module.

  As I said in previous comments, I held the cc1150 module against the itho fan module, so that must be good enough.


  This only proved that my modules work with simple code, but still not sure if the itho code really sends and if so: what it sends.
