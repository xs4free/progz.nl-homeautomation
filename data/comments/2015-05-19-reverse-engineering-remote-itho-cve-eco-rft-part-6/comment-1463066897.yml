  A few bytes will be incorrect when you are gonna use your own device id. Jimmy did some work on this already for his remote. You will need to press buttons to find out the relation between the counter bytes. I believe the only changes are related with the starting offset within the arrays. But it should not be that hard since you have a nice log of all bytes ;),  It is a lot of work since one cycle of the counter is 256 button presses. Also you have to be careful with the button. After thousands of button presses it ruins the buttons. Especially when you want to test button combinations.


  I am busy with work the next months so I am not working on it anymore. For me the code is good enough, for now. It works and there is a possibility we never find a algorithm which works for all device id's. There could be a chance the counter, device id or some other variable which influences the calculation is stored in EEPROM on the remote.
