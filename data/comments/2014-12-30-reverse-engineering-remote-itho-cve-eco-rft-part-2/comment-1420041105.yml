body: You are totally right Marc, I could hack the switches on the remote with a transistor. I actually found someone online that did just that. I decided on reverse-enginering because I still want to use the remote afterwards (so I actually want to create an extra remote), and new remotes are expensive (around €70). And this way I'm learning a lot more! :)
