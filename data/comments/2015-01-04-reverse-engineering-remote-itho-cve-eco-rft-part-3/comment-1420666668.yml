  Hi Gerben,

  I have no experience yet with a rfxcom. But if it can sent an rf signal on a specific channel with a specific modulation than it should be possible to sent the same signals as the Itho remote. When I have a working example with a CC1150 or CC1101 chipset, I might also look at sending the signal with a simpeler rf-chipset and/or a rfxcom.

  Keep on reading my blog for further updates!


  Regards, Rogier.
