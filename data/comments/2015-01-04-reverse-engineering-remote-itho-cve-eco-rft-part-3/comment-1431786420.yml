body: "Hey Patrick,\n\nThanks for your long and insightful comment! I would love to receive the .NET application you wrote. Can you email it to \"Rogier dot Reedijk AT gmail dot com\"? Or else create a simple GitHub repository and post a link?\nI would also love to see a picture of how you connected the analyzer to the remote control. Did you also use helping hands and pins?\nAnd if it's not to much trouble I would love to receive some logical analyzer capture files you made. Because with those I could find out which bytes change between different remote controls!\n\nI'm still working on reverse engineering the messages and took a big step forward this weekend. I've got all 4 buttons working now and I'm busy writing a blog post about it (should be up this weekend). The source code is already uploaded to my regular GitHub repository for this project:\nhttps://github.com/xs4free/Itho-library\nAnd the most recent logical analyzer files (and my own C# program) are in another repository:\nhttps://github.com/xs4free/Itho-project\n\nI think that I understand most of the data that's being transmitted by the remote. It's a bit much to explain in this comment, so please read my next blog-post that should be up on this blog tomorrow.\n\nMy goal is almost the same as yours, I want to control the ventilation based on the humidity in my bathroom. Only, I want to keep the sensor and the ventilation control separated. So I want to create a home-automation server that reads the humidity and based on that value, changes the speed of the ventilation.\n\nI also investigated extracting the firmware from the remote, but came to the same conclusion, the AT Mega is most likely protected. And that would make it nearly impossible.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you! And would love to help where I can.\nIf you buy the same RF board (CC1150) as I have bought, than you can use my code and be up and running very quickly! \n\nKind regards, RogierR."
