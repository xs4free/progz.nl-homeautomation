body: "I just mailed you all my files including a photo. \n\nI soldered pins on the print so I could easily connect the analyzer. I don't have helping hands or a lot of tools so this was the only option for me.\n\nI'm also going to use it in my bathroom. Maybe I will connect everything to a base system, it would be nice to be able to make config changes on a touchscreen. I already did some quick research on the OpenTherm protocol because that would be the next step. I want to control humidity by the ventilation system and by controlling the temperature.\n\nI assumed the reverse engineering would be the hardest part so that's why I started with this. If I didn;t manage to reverse engineer then I didn't waste much money on this project (except for the programmerdebugger board)."
