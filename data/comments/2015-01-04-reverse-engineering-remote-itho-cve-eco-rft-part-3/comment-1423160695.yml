  Hi Sijmen,


  Nice to hear that you would also like to control the ITHO box!


  The frequency you've found is just about correct. I see that I've made a mistake writing my blog above. If you look at the first table in this blogpost, on the last line you can see the frequency I've calculated originally based on the SPI data: 868,299865 MHz. Further down in this post I tried to reproduce the formula I used to calculate it and made a mistake which resulted in 866,699064 MHz. So your 868,240000 MHz is very close to my correct calculation. (I will correct my blogpost as soon as possible)


  In my first blogpost about reverse engineering the Itho remote I've included a link to a blogpost from a collegue of mine, which also has the older ITHO remote: http://zigbeeme.blogspot.nl/2014/10/decoding-itho-rf-protocol.html

  He has also included some Arduino code that works on his ITHO box. So maybe, with some adjustments, it could work for you as well.


  I'm busy writing a follow-up post on my progress and will link to the captured data in that post.


  If you make any progress with controlling your ITHO-box, please let me know, I would love to hear/read about problems you ran into and how you solved them.


  Keep on reading this blog for my progress!
