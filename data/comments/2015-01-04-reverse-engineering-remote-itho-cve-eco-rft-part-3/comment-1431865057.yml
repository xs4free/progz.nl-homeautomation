  I have compared my messages with one of yours and some values are different.


  Byte 6,7,8,13,14,15,36,39,40,41,58 (zero based index).


  In my messages these bytes always contain the same value. So they seem to be connected to the device itself. Maybe the values are set during initialisation of the remote, maybe they are fixed.


  If there really is some unique reference to each remote then I am wondering why the whole circus with changing sequences is used. To lower the chance of interference with other RF transmitting devices? Or only because of reverse engineering? Don't know if there could be other reasons.


  I was also thinking about your message which was accepted after 300 resends. What happens when the base station misses one message from the remote? Will it be out of sync until init of the remote? or are the sequences not that critical and allow some mistakes in it? I was guessing for the last one because otherwise Itho could get a lot of complaints from customers. I just checked this point on my CVE. I unplugged the power and used the remote a couple of times. After putting back the power it still works using the remote. Also a battery change did not introduce any problem. So it allows some missing messages during transfer. It would be interesting to know how many missing messages are accepted.
