  Hi Rogier,


  Very nice job indeed. I am also tinkering with a Software Defined Radio and an ITHO RF transmitter. No background in software or electrical engineering whatsoever. :/

  My goal is to make an Arduino receiver because I have an old Itho WTW ventilation system which is not compatible with a RFT receiver.

  I see I've got a slightly different (programmed) ITHO transmitter, the SDR receives a signal at about 868,240000 MHz, also the number printed at top the PCB in '7 segment display' font is "1033" instead of "1413".


  It's the 536-0125 RFT transmitter unit: http://www.ithodaalderop.nl/sites/default/files/documents/historisch_overzicht_rf_bedieningen_ventilatie_units.pdf


  Soldering probe wires onto the PCB isn't going to do it I see. I think I'll buy some extra 3rd hands and use my Bus Pirate / Logic Sniffer combo to read the SPI traffic.


  Can you share the spreadsheet with all the captured data for study?


  With regards,


  Sijmen
