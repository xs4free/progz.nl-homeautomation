body: "Hi Pieter,\n\nI must admit this last post was very in-depth. This is all very new to me as well, but I'm trying to document my steps as good as possible. I've got a background in software enginering, but not in electrical enginering nor in embedded software, so bare with me. :-)\n\nBut your summary is right, I'll be able to write some code now that controls the Itho. I'm currently busy writing the code, when that's finished I'll write a follow-up post about it.\n\nAs far as I can tell, only the remote controls have a unique id. When you first power-up the ventilation box you have a short time (i think about a minute) to register all remote-controls in the house with the box. You do this by pressing two buttons on the remote at the same time. The remote then sents out a signal with it's id and from that point on that remote is able to control the ventilationbox.\nThe messages that I've recorded contain the unique id for my own remote. This id can be registered with any Itho ventilationbox, so my code should work on all boxes. \n\nIt would be even better if I had a second remote to test with, because then I could determine which bytes of the protocol contain the id.\nWhen I've seen that the code works, I'll be asking around for another remote control that I can borrow to see if I can give each home-automation-controller a unique id.\n\nThanks for your reply! (it's motivating to hear that other people would like to use the same code)"
