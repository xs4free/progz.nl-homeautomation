  Hi Rogier,


  Nice job! I have the same wish, but not the same skills:-) You lost me in this third part, lol.

  But form what I understand, you'll be able to write some code now, so that the Itho can be controlled? Great!

  Would that be a generic code? Or is there some kind of ID that makes each box unique and a generic code would not work?


  Anyhow, keep up the good work. I can't wait.
