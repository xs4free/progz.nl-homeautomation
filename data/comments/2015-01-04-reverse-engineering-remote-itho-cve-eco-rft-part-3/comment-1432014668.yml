body: "I'm going the take a closer look at the excelsheet you sent me. \n\nDo keep in mind that the binary data you have recorded comes from 2 different messages, that are transmitted on 2 different frequencies. The first message is exactly 20 bytes long and the second message is 50 bytes plus 3 bits.\n\nI do think each remote has a programmed or generated unique identifier. I don't know if there is any logic in the bytes for this identifier (maybe it has a checksum of some sorts). Currently I have recorded analyzer traces from 2 different remotes, so I have 2 unique identifiers. If my \"join\" command works (I need to test this) then everyone should be able to use my code and use the identifier from my remote.\n\nThe changes of the sequence number is used by the ventilation box to determine if you have pressed the same button multiple times. This is needed for the timer button, because if you press it once the box will run at full speed for 10 minutes, if you press the timer button twice the box will run for 20 minutes, and so on. If the RF message would not contain a sequence number, the ventilation box would not be able to distinguish between receiving the same message multiple times and receiving a second button press.\n\nThanks for testing what happens when you press the remote buttons without the box being powered on! I hadn't gotten around to testing that yet.\n\nI have been testing my code for one evening now and it is working perfectly. In code I'm using the same identifier as the physical remote and both remotes work fine at every button press. So the ventilation box isn't checking that the sequence numbers are increasing/decreasing. This leads me to believe that my current code is overly complicated (i'm keeping track of my previous buttons press and 2 counters in the Arduino). If I find some time, I'll experiment some more with the code and see if the code works with a fixed number.\n\nPlease read the last blogpost I added today and let me know what you think!"
