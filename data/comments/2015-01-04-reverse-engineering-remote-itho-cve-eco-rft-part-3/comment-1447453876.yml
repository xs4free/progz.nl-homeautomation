body: "Hi Marco,\nIf you read my last post, http://www.progz.nl/blog/index.php/2015/05/reverse-engineering-remote-itho-cve-eco-rft-part-6/ , you can read how far I got. I haven't integrated my controller into a home automation system yet, but I am able to control the Itho ventilation box. \nCurrently I'm very busy packing, because I'm moving to a new home within a few weeks. The new home currently does not have an Itho box, but does need a new ventilation system. So as soon as I am settled in, and have replaced the box by an Itho, then I will try and integrate it into a home automation system. \nWhat system are you using? Or what system do you like?"
