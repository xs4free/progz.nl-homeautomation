  Thanks for the photo and the explanation! Soldering pins to the testpads seems like a very stable way to analyze the messages between the AtMega and the CC1150.


  I have also been looking at the OpenTherm protocol and currently have all the parts to create an OpenTherm Gateway: http://otgw.tclcode.com/

  That will most likely be my next project after I create a humidity sensor for my bathroom!
