  Hello,


  I am also working an a home automation project using cubietruck and nrf24l01 modules.


  I advise you to install debian on the cubie instead of lubuntu.

  Here is the link to a russina guy that made a killer distro for cubie.

  How`s the progress going ..mine is preety slow as i am trying to simulate an mqtt server(publish/subscriber based) in python. I will have a master arduino which gateways all nrf messages from sensors and such to a serial on the cubie.


  Maybe we can share some ideas... my mail is bogyxp on Y!


  Best of luck!
