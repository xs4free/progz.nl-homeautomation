  Hi Bogy,

  Thanks for the tip on Debian. It looks like Igor is really supporting his Debian build. I might just switch to his image.


  The process is going slowly (mainly because I don't have enough free time).

  Currently I'm trying to connect the NRF24 module directly to the Cubietruck. I've found a NodeJS library that talk directly to the NRF24 module and prefer that to adding another arduino and a serial connection. But if the library doesn't work I will also be using an Arduino and a serial connection.


  What type of sensor are you planning on using? And where will you be storing the data?

  I've got lots of ideas, now I just need more free time to implement/build them! :)


  I will sent you an email to see if we can share code/ideas in the future!

  Thanks for your reply.
