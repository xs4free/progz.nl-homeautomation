I realize this is now a few years after your original post, but being a novice coder I have not had any luck finding an answer that I can implement--do you know if the MS Graph API provides any way to determine whether the webcam is in use during a Teams meeting/call? Or perhaps there is another method of detecting device (i.e., webcam) status? It would be handy to update the LED based on a video call vs a simple audio call."
