My previous post [Reverse engineering remote Itho CVE ECO RFT – Part 6](http://www.progz.nl/blog/index.php/2015/05/reverse-engineering-remote-itho-cve-eco-rft-part-6/) was written over a year ago, but there are still people replying in the comments of that post (over 100 comments on one blogpost!). A lot of people seem to be interested in automating their Itho CVE. One question that keeps on getting asked is: How do I get started and what do I need?

What you need to get started is relatively simple:


1.  [Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V 8 MHz with the ATMega 328P chip](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ProMini-ATmega328P-3-3V-Compatible-for-Arduino-Pro-Mini/32525927539.html) ($1,49 USD)
There are also 5V Pro Mini's available, but they will damage the RF tranceiver if connected without extra components, so order the Arduino with the right voltage!
2.  [Texas Instruments CC1101 Wireless RF Transceiver 868 MHz with antenna](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-1pcs-lot-868-M-915-MHZ-CC1101-wireless-data-Best-quality/32537344132.html) ($6,97 USD)
This is chip on a small board. The chip itself supports multiple operating frequencies (315/433/868/915 MHz). The components (filters) on the board determine which frequency is actually send to the antenna. We need a board that is specifically designed for 868 MHz. On eBay this is usually somewhere in the description, called "Default working frequency: 868Mhz" or "Carrier frequency 868MHz". If this is not specified, search for another board, because it's likely a 433MHz filter configuration (default for America and China).
This board also comes in two different layouts, one has 2 rows of pins on one side in a breadboard friendly 0.1-inch (2.54mm) pitch. The other boardlayout is more of a square with connectors in a single row, in a 0.079inch (2mm) pitch. Personally I prefer the first layout, because it required less soldering (just use jumper wires at first) and I find the 2mm pin pitch harder to solder.
3.  [FTDI USB to TTL Serial Adapter](http://r.ebay.com/ZEYY7X) with USB-cable ($6,95 USD)
This is a programmer for the Arduino Pro Mini. Be sure to order one that supports 3.3V.
There are a few other hardware options that will work, but the above combination has been tested by myself and others, so if you are new to programming Arduino's and/or electronics, this is the hardware I would recommend.

From a software perspective you need to download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and maybe a [driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) to get the FTDI USB adapter recognized (although the driver is probably already on your system if you are using Windows). SparkFun has a great tutorial on [how to install the IDE and driver](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide).

Then the interesting part of the software is the actual code that will run on the Arduino. When I started reverse engineering the Itho, I wrote code that sent the exact same commands as my remote. This code worked, but wasn't perfect. In the comments of blog part 6, a few people replied that took my code and/or research and created a fork or their own implementation. A very big THANK YOU goes out to: Klusjesman, Jimmy and JFDB. They finished what I started. The code that works best with the above hardware can be found here: https://github.com/supersjimmie/IthoEcoFanRFT

Download all the code and open the file with the ino-extension in the Arduino IDE. Burn/upload this code to the Arduino Pro Mini and connect the Arduino to the CC1101 as described in the read.me file.

The Arduino code contains an identifier for a new remote that your Itho ventilation unit does not know about yet. Therefor you need to unplug the Itho from power, replug it again and then it will accept new remote identifiers for the next 2 minutes. If you now power cycle the Arduino it will sent a join-message to the Itho. This power cycle of the Itho is only necessary for the first time, it will remember the identifier (until you sent a leave message).

The default code from Jimmy will now start listening to all messages broadcasted by other remotes. To make it sent a message on a button press, I've created a forked repo:

 

In the near future I'm hoping to add an MQTT listener to the code and run it standalone on an ESP8266.

I am very great full to the above mentioned people for taking the time to improve/finish my project and share their experience and code. I would love to hear how you use this code and welcome all improvements!

It also registers an ID with your fan so it will listen to the commands you send.
You only need to do that once using the Join(). In Jimmy s code this command is run standard at startup.
You need to unplug and replug the eco fan, then it listens for 2 minutes for a possible join command.
You need a CC1101 module and a unit that can run arduino code (like ESP8266 or Arduino pro mini or something alike) and solder the commections between the arduino processor and the CC1101.
Good luck
